# Update Workflows to use Least Privileged GITHUB_TOKEN permissions

## Tutorial

In this tutorial you will update the token permissions for workflows in this repository so they have the minimum permissions needed.

1. You can see the permissions that GITHUB_TOKEN has for a specific job in the "Set up job" section of the workflow run log. Check the permissions for different jobs that you have run so far. You will notice that the permissions are set to `write` for several scopes.

2. You can set the minimum token permissions for each job in the workflow file. Doing so manually is cumbersome, as you need to learn the different permissions and need to know what permissions are used by each step.

3. To set the permissions automatically navigate to https://app.stepsecurity.io/securerepo. Enter your repository in the textbox and click on `Analyze Repository`. You will see several recommendations for improving GitHub Actions Security for your repository.

4. Keep the `Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN` checked and un-check the rest of the recommendations for now. We will check them in future tutorials.

5. Click on `Create Pull Request` button. You will see a pull request with the token permissions set in each of the workflow files.

6. Merge the pull request. Check the permissions for the jobs in the "Set up job" section of the workflow run log. You will notice that the permissions are set to the minimum needed.
