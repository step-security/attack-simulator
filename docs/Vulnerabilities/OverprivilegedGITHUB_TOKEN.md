# Overprivileged GITHUB_TOKEN

At the start of each workflow run, GitHub automatically creates a unique GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow. You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate in a workflow run.

From the [GitHub Actions Hardening Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#stealing-the-jobs-github_token):

> It is possible for an attacker to steal a job's GITHUB_TOKEN. Once expired, the token is no longer useful to an attacker. To work around this limitation, they can automate the attack and perform it in fractions of a second by calling an attacker-controlled server with the token.

> The attacker server can use the GitHub API to modify repository content, including releases, if the assigned permissions of GITHUB_TOKEN are not restricted.
