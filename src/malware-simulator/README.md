# Malware-Simulator Package

To simulate behavior of [past compromised packages](../CompromisedDependency.md), StepSecurity has created a package called [@step-security/malware-simulator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@step-security/malware-simulator). The simulator is NOT actual malware; the package just makes an outbound call to www.stepsecurity.io in a `preinstall` step

This package can be used by developers to:

1. Understand how malicious packages make outbound calls as part of the install steps
2. How the [Harden-Runner GitHub Action](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) can find this behavior ([tutorial](../CompromisedDependency.md))
3. Use as a test package for your applications â€“ to check if defenses are working as expected

You can think of the @step-security/malware-simulator being similar to the [EICAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file) anti-virus simulator file, which is used as a test file for anti-virus software.
